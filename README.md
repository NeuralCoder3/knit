# Knit

## Introduction

Knit is a simple web application showing various knitting patterns
and helping knitters keep track of progress
(i.e., which row am I on?).

## Current state

As of 2024-04-19, this is work in progress,
it's barely usable.
I expect to make progress quickly towards something useful for other knitters.
